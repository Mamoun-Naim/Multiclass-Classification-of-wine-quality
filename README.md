# Multiclass Classification of wine quality
In this Project two datasets related to red and white wine samples will be analysed. 
The aim is to model the wine quality from personal taste based on measured physicochemical vlaues.

## Data Files:	
In this work we analyse the two datasets "winequality-red.csv" and "winequality-white.csv" on wine quality available from
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/

## Environment and tools: 
Python with the multiclass models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier and Artificial Neural Networks.

## Results: 
	Muticlass classification accuracy of 64 %
	multiclassifier with tolerance of 1 leads to accuracy of 95%
	multiclassifier with tolerance of 2 leads to accuracy of nearly 100%
